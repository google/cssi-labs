## Background

#### Your principal has submitted requests for you to add new content AND update some aspects of styling. It's up to you to make sure the website turns out to be informational and *stylish*.

Live preview the html file currently in this folder to see what the website
looks like right now....

Hmm, we seem to be missing some things! Let's fix this up.

## Content Challenges


Let's get the essentials done first...
1. Create a list in the **info** `div` with all of the things that you think
make Google High School great. Feel free to get creative and add in the perks
that your dream high school would have. Personally, I'm a huge fan of puppies in
the library.
2. Underneath your list add an image of what you imagine Google High School
would look like.
3. Come up with a slogan that represents the school, insert this as an `h4` in
the **header** div.
4. You may have noticed that every link in the **links** `div` goes to
google.com.... change the link tags so that the "learn" link goes to your
favorite studying website and the "share" link goes to your favorite social
media's home page.
5. Create a new `div`, and make sure to give it a class name so you can style it
later. Put a heading of any size inside your `div` that says "Some of our
students...". Underneath, put three pictures of your classmates' faces. Make
sure to ask for permission before adding a picture. Alternatively, look up some
images of studious high school students from the internet and add those in.

Better, definitely better.

## Style Steps


Now that we have some more content, let's get stylin'. Make sure you have your
`style.css` file open to make some adjustments.
1. Give your info `div` a background color; it doesn't have to follow the google
color theme, but if you want it to check out this
[link](https://color.adobe.com/Google-color-theme-8746933/edit/?copy=true&base=2&rule=Custom&selected=2&name=Copy%20of%20Google&mode=rgb&rgbvalues=0.290196,0.458824,0.901961,0.917647,0.145098,0.2,0.996078,0.737255,0.121569,0.266667,0.439216,0.901961,0.0313726,0.686275,0.133333&swatchOrder=0,1,2,3,4).
2. Add a border to your **links** `div`. Go crazy with color, thickness, and
style.
3. Italicize your original slogan to make it **pop**. Think carefully about how
you can uniquely **ID**entify your slogan in the html so that you can make sure
only the slogan is italicized.
4. Change the background color of the `div` you created in step five of the html
section above.
5. Make the pictures of students that you added to the site round... If you
don't know where to begin try looking into border radius.

This looks **SO** much better...

## Extensions

But alas, our work is never truly done. If you're on a roll and have things you
want to fix, keep rolling. If you're looking for some inspiration, look no
further than the extensions listed below...
+ Try out some new fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). Click
the plus sign select the font, then select the **standard** option for embed.
Copy and paste the first thing under standard into the head of your HTML, and
the CSS code into your CSS file.
+ Move the picture of the school to the center of the page.
+ Add more pictures! Align them all in one row.
+ Place all of the information you wrote onto a card and `absolute`ly position
it in the center of your page.
+ Hide as many small pictures of either yourself or a turtle as you can on your
website without the person next to you being able to find them immediately.
+ More links! More info! More everything!
