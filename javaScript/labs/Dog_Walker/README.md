#### Introduction
You've decided to start a new neighborhood business and help everyone out by walking their dogs. In order to streamline your process you've decided to write code that will schedule your time for you.

Your javascript file is linked to the index.html file that you've been given using a script tag. If you open up the html page and use inspect to see the console, you'll be able to see the outputs of your code! Refresh the page to make the script run again. When you see the word "print" in the task, you should be using console.log in your code. Make sure to double check that the output you are receiving is correct. Feel free to change up the variable values in order to test your code!

#### Tasks
You've been given a variables named dogName and dogType. You will use the variables ending in the number corresponding to the task number. For example, you will use dogName1 for task 1. You should be using console.log for each statement that you need to "print".

1. Begin by writing a script that prints a basic scheduling statement. This code should use the variable holding the dogs name that needs to be walked and print a string saying "I will walk **\*insert name*** today at 12:00pm".

2. Next, write code that uses two different variables, dogName2 and dogType2. If the dog type is a corgi, console log "I will walk **\*insert name*** today at 12:00pm". Otherwise, print "I will walk **\*insert name*** today at 1:00pm". Test out this code by changing to dogType 2 to corgi and making sure that the printed statement changes.

Now you realize that you don't have enough corgis for this to evenly split your clientele, and your 1:00 walk is still very crowded.

3. Create an advanced scheduling script in the location of the script file designated by the comments so that if the dog type is a corgi or a beagle you will print "I will walk **\*insert name*** today at 12:00pm", if the dog is a bulldog you will print "I will walk **\*insert name*** today at 1:00pm", otherwise print "I will walk **\*insert name*** today at 2:00pm".

#### Extension
Create your own dogOwner variable. Add to your script so you can identify your favorite dogs to their owners. If the dogs name is Spike, Jeremy, Lola, Peaches, or Steve, your code should print "I will walk **\*insert name***, one of my favorite dogs, today at **\*insert correct time based on rules above***.
  * Think about how you can account for the different ways people may enter their dogs names. If the variable value is "spike", "sPike", "SPIKE", or any other combination of capital and lowercase letters, you should still be returning the same thing.
