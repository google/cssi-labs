#### Background
I promise you that once upon a time Magic 8 Balls were THE thing. If you had a yes or no question that needed answering, your Magic 8 Ball was there to save the day. Unfortunately, the Magic 8 Ball stock has gone way down, the demand is low, and the inventory is high. As we all know, that's not a good place for a product to be. The Magic 8 Ball makers of the world have reached out to you to create a digital version of their product in hopes that once kids get a hold of the Magic 8 Ball on the computer, they'll want the real life one as well.

#### Task
You've been given the HTML for a basic Magic 8 Ball. Your job is to make sure that when you click on the Magic 8 Ball, it answers your question. Each time you click on it a different **random** phrase will come up. Some example responses are shown below. Choose at least ten of the responses and include them in your Magic 8 Ball. Feel free to include your own creative answers to people's questions.

#### Extension
Separate the different kinds of responses into three different arrays. Each time you click have your code randomly choose which kind of response, and then randomly choose a specific answer from that list. Make positive responses green, negative responses red, and noncommittal responses yellow. Good luck!
