## Background
With a million places to choose from, it's hard to decide where exactly you should order that super cool bean bag chair that you must have for your freshman year dorm room. But don't fret! Dormdecor.com is here to save the day.

## Task
Preview the html and css page given. You should see several pictures of different types of potential dorm decorations. As you move through the lab you'll be using `querySelector` and `console.log` to print out the things you must have for your dorm room.

### Posters
Everyone wants their dorm to feel like home, and your wall decor can play a huge role in that. Using the `querySelector` method, create a variable that holds the poster you would want in your dorm room. Then use `console.log` to make sure you've selected the right poster. You should be working in the `script.js` file provided.

### Chairs
Who doesn't want to have the comfiest, coolest chair in the whole hall? Select the chair you want, and `console.log` the chair, the id of the chair you selected, and the list of classes assigned to that specific chair.

### Lighting
The right lighting will create unbeatable ~vibes~ in your dorm room. Format your selection nicely. Select the `h3` that holds the Lighting header, and `console.log` the `innerHTML` of the h3. Then, print "I have selected the element: *insert element here*", and "This element has the id *insert id* and the classes *insert class list*". Combine what you know about string interpolation and JavaScript to accomplish this.

## Congratulations! Your dorm is decorated!
